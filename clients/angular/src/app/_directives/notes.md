In Angular, Directives are defined as classes that can add new behavior 
to the elements in the template or modify existing behavior. 
The purpose of Directives in Angular is to maneuver the DOM, 
be it by adding new elements to DOM or removing elements 
and even changing the appearance of the DOM elements
